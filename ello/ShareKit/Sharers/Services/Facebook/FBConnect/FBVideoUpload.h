/*
    Uploads video to Facebook using a combination of the old
    and the new API/SDK.

    Please note that this code parses the access token from
    the Facebook class, which is quite brittle, unofficial and
    could easily break with the upcoming SDK releases. Also it
    seems to only work with the older, pop-up authentication and
    not the new one that uses app switching. (The new authentication
    scheme seems to result in a different auth token format
    that we canâ€™t parse.)
